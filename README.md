# Practice Git + SourceTree Repo

This repository is for practicing Git workflows with SourceTree:

- Cloning
- Staging & committing
- Pushing & pulling
- Working with branches
- Merging and resolving simple conflicts

The example project is a small “Practice Quote App” built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This line was added directly on GitHub to practice pulling changes.
